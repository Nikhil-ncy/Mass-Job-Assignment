# Mass-Job-Assignment

This project contains the dataset of the cost of assigning different tasks to different person and I tried to upscale the job assignment for a bigger dataset of 10k people (likewise dealt in industries) as part of the course "Introduction to Operations Research". 
The codes here also help in generating the dataset. For large dataset, dask and scipy have been used for parallelizing computational resources.
