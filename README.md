# Mass-Job-Assignment

This project contains the dataset of the cost of assigning different tasks to different person and I tried to upscale the job assignment for a bigger dataset of 10k people (likewise dealt in industries) as part of the course "Introduction to Operations Research". 
<br /><br />The codes here also help in generating the dataset. For large dataset, dask and scipy have been used for parallelizing computational resources.
